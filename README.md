# Playlist Maker

Playlist Maker is a program in progress built in python using pytube, moviepy and PySimpleGui.

## About

This is my first project in python apart from coursework I am currently taking. I had an issue where I really wanted to be able to listen to some songs that weren't out anywhere but YouTube at the moment. So I started thinking of ways that I could accomplish that. It was fun putting this together and I'm looking forward to making it better as I have the time!

Playlist Maker allows a user to download or create clips from a given YouTube URL or .mp4 file. The GUI allows for anyone of any experience to create their own playlist!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

2.  ```bash
    pip install pytube
    pip install moviepy
    pip install PySimpleGui
    ```

## Running the Program

**First create two directories in the root: downloaded & songs**

1. Move mp4 files that you want to change into the downloaded folder. (If you have them.)

2. Run pm_gui.py.

3. Either paste a YouTube URL or the name of the file in downloaded.

4. Enter a start and end time in seconds for your clip/song.

5. Submit and check the songs or clips directory!

6. For additional songs or clips just re-enter a new start and end time.

**Export functionality coming soon! (Now Live)**

**Next: Gui Updates**
