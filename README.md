# Playlist Builder

Playlist Builder is a program in progress built in python using pytube and moviepy.

## About

This is my first project in python apart from coursework I am currently taking. I had an issue where I really wanted to be able to listen to some songs that weren't out anywhere but YouTube at the moment. So I started thinking of ways that I could accomplish that. It was fun putting this together and I'm looking forward to making it better as I have the time!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

2. 
```bash
pip install pytube
pip install moviepy
```
