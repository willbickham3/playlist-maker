# Playlist Builder

Playlist Builder is a program in progress built in python using pytube and moviepy.

## About

This is my first project in python apart from coursework I am currently taking. I had an issue where I really wanted to be able to listen to some songs that weren't out anywhere but YouTube at the moment. So I started thinking of ways that I could accomplish that. It was fun putting this together and I'm looking forward to making it better as I have the time!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

2. 
```bash
pip install pytube
pip install moviepy
```

## Running the Program

1. Move mp4 files that you want to change into the downloaded folder. (If you have them.)

2. Run pm_gui.py.

3. Either paste a YouTube URL or the name of the file in downloaded.

4. Enter a start and end time in seconds for your clip/song.

5. Submit and check the songs directory!

** Export functionality coming soon! **
